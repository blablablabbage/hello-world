# hello-world
I'm just here to see how far this can go.

I constantly learn and ignore, and while the "ignore" mention can be seen in a negative light, i figure about enough time has passed for me where i would be practicing insanity if i decided to make a move with something that has given me no gain countless times in the past. once you notice the signs and the hints of signs you know what to avoid.
